# Awesome-Project

Scrum project thoughts. How did it go. Challenges how it went. Pros cons. Need to add teacher.

I think it went pretty well, we were able to finish it in time(though sending the projectwent on a bit long). Everyone was able to contribute even if Zho Ton(? I am unsure how his name is written) had trouble getting his thoughts across, because of language barrier. The start was very rough since we didn't have any clue what the project was even suppoused to do. Also we missed the final 2 pages in the powerpoint that specified Project details, so we mostly used that time figuring out what was needed. After the first 15 minutes Zho(?) however was able to help and explain how the Scrum cycle works and how to apply it so we had a better way forward. Fitting since he was the Scrum Master.

On the second round we moved onward to trying to figure out what was needed, which was housing. I think this was where we decided that the workers were the clients in this case, so we designed the first and second round of housing designs.

The third round went about as smoothly but Jami(I think she said to call herself Jami, I am forgetting her actual name though), started drawing the full map. We were mostly crystallizing and clearing up our ideas, Zhu helping us create the genral shape of the housing zone, while the rest of us cleaned the idea out. The radial design helped the the whole thing be more appealing to people living at the area regardless where they lived. It was not optimal but we did have only 15 mins.

The final round of scrum was mostly cleaning up, finishing the map, I had a mild breakdown cause I didn't know how the factory worked, figuring out how to leave the factory town and some other things. Shoshe was the one who did the final map, for the record.

After that we had our presentation that I led. I think it went well. Once everyone got the idea on what we were suppoused to do, it all clicked better.

Pros: Easy to make larger projects with lot of rewrites. Fast. Lots of ideas, that we were able to focus on seperately.

Cons: Even though I say we were able to crystallize the project towards the end, we also did lose some of the focus at the end. It is also easy to focus on the wrong thing. Hard to reign in a group of people without head of project. Hard to make something truly unique? Projects can balloon out of control? Sorry, I am a biit unsure on how to describe Scrum project cycle still.

Ok, that should be everything!
